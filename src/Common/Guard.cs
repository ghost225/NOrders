    // taking the mod down with it. This is the same principle a step later, for
    // a patch that attaches and then throws while running: on Weapon.Fire that
    // is every shot fired by anyone in the match, and on a FixedUpdateState it
    // is fifty times a second. The exception itself is rarely the worst of it.
    // The log fills, the frame rate goes, and the real fault is buried.
    //
    // So the first exception retires that one patch for the session and says so
    // once. The feature it carried is lost; nothing else is. Borrowed from
    // NOAutopilot, which does this globally -- the whole mod unpatches itself
    // on the first error. Per patch suits a mod made of many small independent
    // ones better: losing cargo missions should not cost you damage control.
