    // Why a recovered aircraft sits on the deck.
    //
    // An aircraft that lands under AI leaves by one of two doors, both inside
    // the ejection sequence that runs once the crew is out:
    //
    //     if (speed < 2 && HQ.AnyNearAirbase(position, out _) && position.y > sea)
    //     { unitState = Abandoned; ReturnToInventory(); }
    //     else if (!disabled) { ...; DisableUnit(); }
    //
    // Either one removes it, so an aircraft still standing there means the
    // sequence did not reach the test, or the test was reached and something
    // threw before the removal. Reasoning about which has been wrong twice, so
    // this records which doors are actually opened and what the test was
    // looking at when it ran.
