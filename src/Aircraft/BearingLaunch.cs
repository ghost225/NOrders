    // on, and every few seconds home on any radar that has been painting them
    // inside their seeker cone. That is exactly the shot you want down an ESM
    // bearing, where there is no fix to target -- only a direction. The catch
    // is which way "on" is: the seeker starts along the launcher's axis, so a
    // round from a vertical cell would search straight up. So each round is
    // fired from its launcher with no target, and as its seeker starts its
    // search heading is set down the ordered bearing.
    //
    // Other seekers need a target (active radar flies blind without one,
    // cruise missiles detonate), so only anti-radiation weapons are offered.
